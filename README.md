# LPG Bullet Tanks â€“ As-Built Drawings (4 Units)

**Project Type**: As-Built Technical Drawings  
**Deliverables**: 3D Models, 2D Layouts, Nozzle & Weld Details

## ðŸ“„ Project Description

This repository contains As-Built technical documentation for **four (4) LPG Bullet Tanks** fabricated and installed in Kenya. The As-Built drawings capture the actual dimensions and configurations post-installation, incorporating all site modifications and field conditions. These files are essential for operations, inspection, and regulatory compliance.

### âœ… Scope of Work

- **3D CAD Models**  
  Final representations of tank geometry, structural supports, and nozzle assemblies.
  
- **2D Layouts**  
  Detailed drawings with accurate dimensions, saddle placements, and nozzle orientations.

- **Nozzle & Weld Detailing**  
  - Verified nozzle schedule reflecting real-world orientation  
  - Weld specifications including:
    - Weld type (butt, fillet, etc.)
    - Size and length
    - Joint preparation methods
    - NDT and inspection notes  
  - Standards followed: **ASME Section VIII**, **API 620/650**

These documents form part of the final deliverables submitted to the project owner and serve as a key reference for maintenance and compliance.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included

- [`LPG TANK G1 LAYOUT.pdf`](./LPG%20TANK%20G1%20LAYOUT.pdf) â€“ 2D layout showing final tank configuration

## ðŸ›  Tools Used

- **AutoCAD** â€“ 2D & 3D technical drafting  
- **Standard Weld Symbol Libraries** â€“ Weld annotations  
- **PDF** â€“ For final drawing distribution
