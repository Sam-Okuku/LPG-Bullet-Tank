# LPG Bullet Tanks – As-Built Drawings (4 Units)

**Client**: TotalEnergies, Kenya  
**Project Type**: As-Built Technical Drawings (3D Models, 2D Layouts, Nozzle & Weld Details)

## Description

This project involved the preparation of detailed **As-Built drawings** for **four (4) LPG Bullet Tanks**, following fabrication and installation for **TotalEnergies** in Kenya. These drawings document the actual constructed state of the tanks and incorporate all field modifications to support inspection, maintenance, and compliance with industry standards.

### Included Deliverables:

- **3D Models**: Finalized 3D CAD models for each tank showing true geometry, structural components, and nozzle assemblies.
- **2D Layouts**: Accurate 2D drawings reflecting final dimensions, saddle placements, and nozzle orientations.
- **Nozzle & Weld Detailing**:
  - Verified nozzle schedule with actual field orientation
  - Complete weld joint specifications including:
    - Weld type (butt, fillet, etc.)
    - Size and length
    - Joint preparation methods
    - Relevant inspection and NDT notes
  - Compliance with **ASME Section VIII** and **API 620/650**

These As-Built drawings form part of the closeout package handed over to **TotalEnergies**, providing a reliable reference for operational use and regulatory inspections.

## Project Files

- [`LPG TANK G1 LAYOUT.pdf`](./LPG%20TANK%20G1%20LAYOUT.pdf) – 2D layout of one of the LPG tanks showing as-built dimensions and nozzle/weld details.

## Tools Used

- **AutoCAD** – For 2D/3D modeling and technical documentation
- **Standard Weld Symbol Libraries** – For weld annotation
- **PDF** – Final documentation format for easy sharing
